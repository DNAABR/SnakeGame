### 1. **Set Up JavaScript Files:**

Create the JavaScript files as outlined in your project structure. Each file will handle different aspects of your game:

- **`main.js`**: Initialize the game and set up the game loop.
- **`game.js`**: Implement the core game logic, such as snake movement, collision detection, and scoring.
- **`engine.js`**: Optimize the game engine for performance, including frame rate management.
- **`controls.js`**: Handle player input and controls.
- **`mechanics.js`**: Define game mechanics like collision detection and dynamic difficulty scaling.
- **`modes.js`**: Implement different game modes (Classic, Time Attack, etc.).
- **`powerups.js`**: Develop the power-up system.
- **`levels.js`**: Design levels and environmental features.
- **`audio.js`**: Integrate audio for sound effects and background music.
- **`ui.js`**: Manage user interface elements and interactions.
- **`tutorial.js`**: Create an interactive tutorial system.
