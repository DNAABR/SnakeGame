You're on the right track thinking about copyright!  Using free and legal sound effects is essential. Here's a breakdown of where you can find sound effects for your snake game, along with tips for ensuring they're truly free to use:

**1. Free Sound Effect Websites (with Creative Commons Licenses):**

These websites are your best bet. They offer a large variety of sounds, and many use Creative Commons licenses, which clearly define how you can use the sounds.  Look specifically for sounds with licenses like CC0 (public domain - use them however you want), CC BY (attribution required - give credit to the creator), or similar permissive licenses.

* **Freesound:** This is a very popular resource.  It has a massive library, and you can filter by license type.  Be sure to carefully check the license for each sound you want to use.
* **Zapsplat:** Offers both free and paid sound effects. The free ones have a clear license you need to follow (usually requiring attribution).
* **SoundBible:**  Another good option with a decent selection.  Again, pay close attention to the licenses.
* **FreeSFX:**  As the name suggests, they offer free sound effects, but double-check the license for each one.

**2. Game Development Asset Stores (Often Have Free Sections):**

Some game asset stores have free sections where they offer sound effects (and other assets) that you can use.  These can be a good source, but make sure to read the license agreements carefully.

* **Itch.io:** While primarily known for indie games, Itch.io also has a section for game assets, including sound effects. Many creators offer free assets, but always check the licensing.
* **Unity Asset Store (If you're using Unity):**  If you're developing your snake game in Unity, their asset store has free sound effects.  Of course, they're generally intended for Unity projects.

**3. Creating Your Own (If You're Inclined):**

If you have some audio editing software (Audacity is a free and excellent option), you can create your own simple sound effects.  This gives you complete control and avoids any copyright issues.  Simple beeps, boops, and other game sounds are often easy to make.

**Key Things to Remember About Licenses:**

* **CC0 (Public Domain):**  Use these sounds for anything, no attribution required.  These are the easiest to work with.
* **CC BY (Attribution):** You *must* give credit to the creator of the sound effect.  The license will usually specify how to do this (e.g., in your game's credits).
* **Other Creative Commons Licenses:**  Read them carefully!  They might have restrictions on commercial use, modifications, etc.
* **Commercial Use:**  If you plan to sell your game, make absolutely certain the sound effects you use are licensed for commercial use.  Free sounds are often for non-commercial projects only.
* **Keep Records:**  Keep a list of the sounds you use, where you got them, and their licenses.  This is essential for proper attribution and avoiding any potential copyright problems down the road.

**For your Snake Game, here are some sound ideas and where you might find them:**

* **Eating:**  A "chomp" or "slurp" sound.  Freesound is a good place to search for these.
* **Game Over:** A "wah-wah" or "sad trombone" sound.  You might even try creating a simple descending tone yourself.
* **Movement:** A subtle "click" or "tick" sound might work, but it could also get annoying if it's too frequent.  Consider if you even need movement sounds.
* **Background Music (Optional):**  If you want background music, look for royalty-free music or music with a suitable Creative Commons license.  Incompetech is a popular source for this.

By following these tips and being diligent about licenses, you can add great sound effects to your snake game without any worries about copyright infringement.  Good luck!
